<p>Im Kampf können Würfe genauso modifiziert werden wie andere Würfe. Solche Modifikatoren können Eigenarten der Feinde, der Umgebung, des Wetters oder zahllose andere Faktoren darstellen. In der folgenden Liste findest du die im Kampf am häufigsten vorkommenden Modifikatoren. Du kannst sie auch als Vergleich bei der Beurteilung nicht erwähnter Faktoren verwenden. Erinnere dich, dass der SL bei jedem Wurf das letzte Wort in Sachen Schwierigkeit hat.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4 class="paragraph" style="text-indent: -.25in; mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in; vertical-align: baseline; margin: 0in 0in .0001pt .25in;">Very Easy (+60)&nbsp;</h4> <ul> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting a Monstrous target (Giant size).</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting into a crowd (13+ targets)</span>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p ><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></p> <h4 ><span data-contrast="none">Easy (+40)</span>&nbsp;</h4> <ul> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting a target at Point Blank Range.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting an Enormous target (Griﬀon size)</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Attacking an opponent you outnumber 3 to 1.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting at a Large group (7&ndash;12 targets).</span>&nbsp;<br /><br /></li> </ul> <h4 ><span  data-contrast="none">Average (+20)</span>&nbsp;</h4> <ul> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting a Large target (Ogre size).</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting at Short Range: less than half weapon range.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting at a small group (3&ndash;6 targets)</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting when you spent your last Action aiming (no Test to aim required).</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Attacking an Engaged opponent in the sides or rear.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Attacking an opponent you outnumber 2 to 1.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Attacking a target with the Prone Condition.</span>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p ><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></p> <h4 ><span data-contrast="none">Challenging (+0)</span>&nbsp;</h4> <ul> <li><span data-contrast="none">A standard attack.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting an Average target (Human size).</span>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p ><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></p> <h4 ><span data-contrast="none">Difficult (-10)</span>&nbsp;</h4> <ul> <li><span data-contrast="none">Attacking whilst you have the @Condition[Prone] Condition, or otherwise beneath your target.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Attacking whilst in the mud, heavy rain or difficult terrain.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting at Long Range: up to double weapon range.</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting on a Round where you also use your Move (walk).</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Shooting a small target (Child size).</span>&nbsp;</li> <li><span data-contrast="none">Target in soft cover (behind a hedge for example).</span>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p ><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;</span></p> <h4 ><span data-contrast="none">Hard (-20)</span>&nbsp;</h4> <ul> <li><span data-contrast="none">A called shot to a specific Hit Location.

Check the @Condition[Unconscious] Condition.</p> <h4>Shooting into a Group</h4> <p>Ranged Tests made to hit a group of targets are <strong>Average (+20)</strong> if there is 3-6 of them, <strong>Easy (+40) </strong>if there are 7-12 of them, and <strong>Very Easy (+60)</strong> if there is 13 or more of them. Any successful hits are randomised between all likely targets as the GM prefers. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.</p> <h4>Outnumbering</h4> <p>If you out-number an opponent 2 to 1, you gain a bonus of +20 to hit your opponent in melee combat. If you outnumber an enemy by 3 to 1, you get an even larger bonus of +40 to hit. Further, at the end of every Round, all outnumbered opponents lose 1 Advantage. Outnumbering is generally determined by how many Characters are Engaged with each other; if there is any doubt, the GM decides who is outnumbering whom.</p> <h4>Size</h4> <p>Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far easier to hit a barn door than an apple. See @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q]{Size}. If this modifier allows you to hit when the Test would otherwise have failed, you succeed with +0 SL.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <h3><em>Combining Difficulties</em></h3> <p><em>There will be instances where multiple factors make taking a particular action more difficult than normal. Lurking in a gloomy forest as you attempt to shoot at a distant opponent through the trees is harder than shooting at the same opponent on a bright day in an open field. When combining multiple difficulties, use the following guidelines:</em></p> <ul> <li><em>If the situation would apply two or more penalties, simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of &ndash;30 or Very Hard. For example, fog and aiming for a specific body part both make Weapon Skill Tests <strong>Hard (&ndash;20)</strong>. When combined, the Test would simply be <strong>Very Hard (&ndash;30),</strong> rather than suffer a &ndash;40 modifier. Similarly, if the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy.</em><br /><br /></li> <li><em>If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add them together to find the new difficulty. Attacking an opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires a <strong>Very Hard (&ndash;30)</strong> Test. But attacking an opponent who is Prone requires an <strong>Easy (+20)</strong> Test. In a situation where both apply, the Test would be <strong>Difficult (&ndash;10) </strong>since &ndash;30 plus +20 equals &ndash;10.</em></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h3><span style="font-style: normal;">Options: Shooting Into Melee</span></h3> <p><span style="font-style: normal;">For most, simply choosing a target and rolling to hit is enough of a complication. However, some prefer the rules be more precise when firing at an Engaged target. If this is you, use the following rules:</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-style: normal;">Ballistic Skill Tests against Engaged opponents are resolved as normal, but suffer a penalty of &ndash;20 as you try your best to hit your specified target. If this modifier causes you to fail when the Test would otherwise have succeeded, you instead hit one of the target&rsquo;s Engaged opponents, as determined randomly by the gM. If you do not care whom you hit, you may gain a bonus of +20 to +60 to hit, see Shooting into a Group.</span></p> </blockquote>
